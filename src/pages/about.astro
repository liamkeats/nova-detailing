      <h1>About Nova Detailing</h1>
      <p>
        Nova Detailing began as a passion project between three university students — 
        <strong>Liam Keats</strong>, <strong>Ben Waterbury</strong>, and <strong>Elijah Kroezen</strong>. 
        While juggling coursework and student life, we decided to create something of our own: 
        a locally-rooted business with the goal of delivering high-end detailing services to the Annapolis Valley and beyond.
      </p>

      <p>
        What started as a summer hustle has quickly grown into a professional operation, 
        with over <strong>100 vehicles detailed</strong> and partnerships with multiple local dealerships. 
        We clean everything — cars, trucks, boats, fleet vehicles, and luxury rides — 
        all through our 100% <strong>mobile detailing service</strong>.
